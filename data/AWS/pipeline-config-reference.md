# Supported plugins and options for Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines<a name="pipeline-config-reference"></a>

Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion supports a subset of sources, processors, and sinks compared to open source Data Prepper\. In addition, there are some constraints that OpenSearch Ingestion places on the available options for each supported plugin\. The following sections describe the plugins and associated options that OpenSearch Ingestion supports\.

**Note**  
OpenSearch Ingestion doesn't support any buffer plugins because it automatically configures a default buffer\. You receive a validation error if you include a buffer in your pipeline configuration\.

## Stateless versus stateful processors<a name="processor-stateful-stateless"></a>

*Stateless* processors perform operations like transformations and filtering, while *stateful* processors perform operations like aggregations that remember the result of the previous execution\. OpenSearch Ingestion supports the stateful processors [Aggregate](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/processors/aggregate/) and [Service\-map](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/data-prepper/pipelines/configuration/processors/service-map-stateful/)\. All other supported processors are stateless\.

For pipelines that contain stateless processors, the maximum capacity limit is 96 Ingestion OCUs\. For stateful processors, the maximum capacity limit is 48 Ingestion OCUs\. For more information, see [Scaling pipelines](ingestion.md#ingestion-scaling)\.

End\-to\-end acknowledgment is only supported for stateless processors\. For more information, see [End\-to\-end acknowledgement](osis-features-overview.md#osis-features-e2e)\.

## Configuration requirements and constraints<a name="ingestion-parameters"></a>

Unless otherwise specified below, all options described in the Data Prepper configuration reference for the supported plugins listed above are allowed in OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines\. The following sections explain the constraints that OpenSearch Ingestion places on certain plugin options\.

**Note**  
OpenSearch Ingestion doesn't support any buffer plugins because it automatically configures a default buffer\. You receive a validation error if you include a buffer in your pipeline configuration\.

Many options are configured and managed internally by OpenSearch Ingestion, such as `authentication` and `acm_certificate_arn`\. Other options, such as `thread_count` and `request_timeout`, have performance impacts if changed manually\. Therefore, these values are set internally to ensure optimal performance of your pipelines\.

Lastly, some options can't be passed to OpenSearch Ingestion, such as `ism_policy_file` and `sink_template`, because they're local files when run in open source Data Prepper\. These values aren't supported\.
