# Using AWS CloudFormation to create Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collections<a name="serverless-cfn"></a>

You can use AWS CloudFormation to create Amazon OpenSearch Serverless resources such as collections, security policies, and VPC endpoints\. For the comprehensive OpenSearch Serverless CloudFormation reference, see [Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/AWS_OpenSearchServerless.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation User Guide*\.

The following sample CloudFormation template creates a simple data access policy, network policy, and security policy, as well as a matching collection\. It's a good way to get up and running quickly with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless and provision the necessary elements to create and use a collection\.

**Important**  
This example uses public network access, which isn't recommended for production workloads\. We recommend using VPC access to protect your collections\. For more information, see [AWS::OpenSearchServerless::VpcEndpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-opensearchserverless-vpcendpoint.html) and [Access Amazon OpenSearch Serverless using an interface endpoint \(AWS PrivateLink\)](serverless-vpc.md)\.
