# What is Amazon OpenSearch Serverless?<a name="serverless-overview"></a>

Amazon OpenSearch Serverless is an on\-demand serverless configuration for Amazon OpenSearch Service\. Serverless removes the operational complexities of provisioning, configuring, and tuning your OpenSearch clusters\. It's a good option for organizations that don't want to self\-manage their OpenSearch clusters, or organizations that don't have the dedicated resources or expertise to operate large clusters\. With OpenSearch Serverless, you can easily search and analyze a large volume of data without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure and data management\.

An OpenSearch Serverless *collection* is a group of OpenSearch indexes that work together to support a specific workload or use case\. Collections are easier to use than self\-managed OpenSearch *clusters,* which require manual provisioning\.

Collections have the same kind of high\-capacity, distributed, and highly available storage volume that's used by provisioned OpenSearch Service domains, but they remove more complexity because they don't require manual configuration and tuning\. Data is encrypted in transit within a collection\. OpenSearch Serverless also supports OpenSearch Dashboards, which provides an intuitive interface for analyzing data\.

Serverless collections currently run OpenSearch version 2\.0\.x\. As new versions are released, OpenSearch Serverless will automatically upgrade your collections to consume new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements\.

## Use cases for OpenSearch Serverless<a name="serverless-use-cases"></a>

OpenSearch Serverless supports two primary use cases:
+ **Log analytics** \- The log analytics segment focuses on analyzing large volumes of semi\-structured, machine\-generated time series data for operational and user behavior insights\.
+ **Full\-text search** \- The full\-text search segment powers applications in your internal networks \(content management systems, legal documents\) and internet\-facing applications, such as ecommerce website content search\. 

 When you create a collection, you choose one of these use cases\. For more information, see [Choosing a collection type](#serverless-usecase)\.

## Getting started<a name="serverless-start"></a>

To get started with OpenSearch Serverless, create one or more collections using the OpenSearch Service console, the AWS CLI, or one of the AWS SDKs\. For a tutorial that helps you get a collection up and running quickly, see [Getting started with Amazon OpenSearch Serverless](serverless-getting-started.md)\.

OpenSearch Serverless supports the same ingest and query API operations as the OpenSearch open source suite, so you can continue to use your existing clients and applications\. Your clients must be compatible with OpenSearch 2\.x in order to work with OpenSearch Serverless\. For more information, see [Ingesting data into Amazon OpenSearch Serverless collections](serverless-clients.md)\.

## How it works<a name="serverless-process"></a>

Traditional OpenSearch clusters have a single set of instances that perform both indexing and search operations, and index storage is tightly coupled with compute capacity\. In contrast, OpenSearch Serverless uses a cloud\-native architecture that separates the indexing \(ingest\) components from the search \(query\) components, with Amazon S3 as the primary data storage for indexes\. 

This decoupled architecture lets you scale search and indexing functions independently of each other, and independently of the indexed data in S3\. The architecture also provides isolation for ingest and query operations so that they can run concurrently without resource contention\. 

When you write data to a collection, OpenSearch Serverless distributes it to the *indexing* compute units\. The indexing compute units ingest the incoming data and move the indexes to S3\. When you perform a search on the collection data, OpenSearch Serverless routes requests to the *search* compute units that hold the data being queried\. The search compute units download the indexed data directly from S3 \(if it's not already cached locally\), run search operations, and perform aggregations\. 

The following image illustrates this decoupled architecture:

OpenSearch Serverless compute capacity for data ingestion, searching, and querying are measured in OpenSearch Compute Units \(OCUs\)\. Each OCU is a combination of 6 GiB of memory and corresponding virtual CPU \(vCPU\), as well as data transfer to Amazon S3\. Each OCU includes enough hot ephemeral storage for 120 GiB of index data\.

When you create your first collection, OpenSearch Serverless instantiates two OCUs—one for indexing and one for search\. To ensure high availability, it also launches a standby set of nodes in another Availability Zone\. This means that a total of four OCUs are instantiated for the first collection in an account\.

These OCUs exist even when there's no activity on any collection endpoints\. All subsequent collections share these OCUs\. When you create additional collections in the same account, OpenSearch Serverless only adds additional OCUs for search and ingest as needed to support the collections, according to the [capacity limits](serverless-scaling.md#serverless-scaling-configure) that you specify\. Capacity does scale back down as your compute usage decreases\.

For information about how you're billed for these OCUs, see [Pricing for OpenSearch Serverless](#serverless-pricing)\.

## Choosing a collection type<a name="serverless-usecase"></a>

OpenSearch Serverless supports three primary collection types:

**Time series** – The log analytics segment that focuses on analyzing large volumes of semi\-structured, machine\-generated data in real\-time for operational, security, user behavior, and business insights\.

**Search** – Full\-text search that powers applications in your internal networks \(content management systems, legal documents\) and internet\-facing applications, such as ecommerce website search and content search\. 

**Vector search** – Semantic search on vector embeddings that simplifies vector data management and powers machine learning \(ML\) augmented search experiences and generative AI applications, such as chatbots, personal assistants, and fraud detection\. 

You choose a collection type when you first create a collection:

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/serverless-collection-type.png)

The collection type that you choose depends on the kind of data that you plan to ingest into the collection, and how you plan to query it\. You can't change the collection type after you create it\.

The collection types have the following notable **differences**:
+ For *search* and *vector search* collections, all data is stored in hot storage to ensure fast query response times\. *Time series* collections use a combination of hot and warm caches, where the most recent data is kept in the hot cache to optimize query response times for more frequently accessed data\.
+ For *time series* and *vector search* collections, you can't index by custom document ID or update by upsert requests\. This operation is reserved for search use cases\. You can update by document ID instead\. For more information, see [Supported OpenSearch API operations and permissions](serverless-genref.md#serverless-operations)\.
+ For *search* and *time series* collections, you can't use k\-NN type indexes\.

## Pricing for OpenSearch Serverless<a name="serverless-pricing"></a>

In OpenSearch Serverless, you're charged for the following components:
+ Data ingestion compute
+ Search and query compute
+ Storage retained in Amazon S3

OCUs are billed on an hourly basis, with per\-second granularity\. In your account statement, you see an entry for compute in OCU\-hours with a label for data ingestion and a label for search\. You're also billed on a monthly basis for data stored in Amazon S3\. You aren't charged for using OpenSearch Dashboards\.

You're billed for a minimum of 4 OCUs for the first collection in your account \(2 x ingest includes primary and standby, and 2 x search includes one active replica for high availability\)\. All subsequent collections can share those OCUs\. OpenSearch Serverless adds additional OCUs based on the compute needed to support your collections\.

**Note**  
Collections with unique AWS KMS keys can't share OCUs with other collections\.

You can configure a maximum number of OCUs for your account in order to control costs\. You're billed for a minimum of 4 OCUs allocated for your workloads when you create a collection\.
