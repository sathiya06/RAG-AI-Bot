# Features by engine version in Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="features-by-version"></a>

Many OpenSearch Service features have a minimum OpenSearch version requirement or legacy Elasticsearch OSS version requirement\. If you meet the minimum version for a feature, but the feature isn't available on your domain, update your domain's [service software](service-software.md)\.

[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/features-by-version.html)

For information about plugins, which enable some of these features and additional functionality, see [Plugins by engine version in Amazon OpenSearch Service](supported-plugins.md)\.
