# Security in Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="security"></a>

Cloud security at AWS is the highest priority\. As an AWS customer, you benefit from a data center and network architecture that is built to meet the requirements of the most security\-sensitive organizations\.

Security is a shared responsibility between AWS and you\. The [shared responsibility model](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) describes this as security *of* the cloud and security *in* the cloud:
+ **Security of the cloud** – AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs AWS services in the AWS Cloud\. AWS also provides you with services that you can use securely\. Third\-party auditors regularly test and verify the effectiveness of our security as part of the [AWS compliance programs](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)\. To learn about the compliance programs that apply to Amazon OpenSearch Service, see [AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program](http://aws.amazon.com/compliance/services-in-scope/)\.
+ **Security in the cloud** – Your responsibility is determined by the AWS service that you use\. You are also responsible for other factors including the sensitivity of your data, your company’s requirements, and applicable laws and regulations\.
