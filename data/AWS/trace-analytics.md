# Trace Analytics for Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="trace-analytics"></a>

You can use Trace Analytics, which is part of the OpenSearch Observability plugin, to analyze trace data from distributed applications\. Trace Analytics requires OpenSearch or Elasticsearch 7\.9 or later\.

In a distributed application, a single operation, such as a user clicking a button, can trigger an extended series of events\. For example, the application front end might call a backend service, which calls another service, which queries a database, which processes the query and returns a result\. Then the first backend service sends a confirmation to the front end, which updates the UI\.

You can use Trace Analytics to help you visualize this flow of events and identify performance problems\.

## Prerequisites<a name="trace-prereq"></a>

Trace Analytics requires you to add [instrumentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/instrumenting/) to your application and generate trace data using an OpenTelemetry\-supported library such as [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) or [Zipkin](https://zipkin.io)\. This step occurs entirely outside of OpenSearch Service\. The [AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry documentation](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/introduction) contains example applications for many programming languages that can help you get started, including Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript\.

After you add instrumentation to your application, the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/getting-started/collector) receives data from the application and formats it into OpenTelemetry data\. See the list of receivers on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/receiver/README.md)\. AWS Distro for OpenTelemetry includes a [receiver for AWS X\-Ray](https://aws-otel.github.io/docs/components/x-ray-receiver)\.

Finally, [Data Prepper](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/data-prepper/index/), an independent OpenSearch component, formats that OpenTelemetry data for use with OpenSearch\. Data Prepper runs on a machine outside of the OpenSearch Service cluster, similar to Logstash\.

For a Docker Compose file that demonstrates the end\-to\-end flow of data, see the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/data-prepper/get-started/)\.

## OpenTelemetry Collector sample configuration<a name="trace-otc"></a>

To use the OpenTelemetry Collector with [Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/ingestion/ingestion.html), try the following sample configuration:

```
extensions:
  sigv4auth:
    region: "us-east-1"
    service: "osis"
 
receivers:
  jaeger:
    protocols:
      grpc:
 
exporters:
  otlphttp:
    traces_endpoint: "https://pipeline-endpoint.us-east-1.osis.amazonaws.com/opentelemetry.proto.collector.trace.v1.TraceService/Export"
    auth:
      authenticator: sigv4auth
    compression: none
 
service:
  extensions: [sigv4auth]
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [jaeger]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

## OpenSearch Ingestion sample configuration<a name="trace-dp"></a>

To send trace data to an OpenSearch Service domain, try the following sample OpenSearch Ingestion pipeline configuration\. For instructions to create a pipeline, see [Creating Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/ingestion/creating-pipeline.html)\.

```
version: "2"
otel-trace-pipeline:
  source:
    otel_trace_source:
      "/${pipelineName}/ingest"
  processor:
    - trace_peer_forwarder:
  sink:
    - pipeline:
        name: "trace_pipeline"
    - pipeline:
        name: "service_map_pipeline"
trace-pipeline:
  source:
    pipeline:
      name: "otel-trace-pipeline"
  processor:
    - otel_traces:
  sink:
    - opensearch:
        hosts: ["https://domain-endpoint"]
        index_type: trace-analytics-raw
        aws:
          # IAM role that OpenSearch Ingestion assumes to access the domain sink   
          sts_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role/pipeline-role"
          region: "us-east-1"
        
service-map-pipeline:
  source:
    pipeline:
      name: "otel-trace-pipeline"
  processor:
    - service_map:
  sink:
    - opensearch:
        hosts: ["https://domain-endpoint"]
        index_type: trace-analytics-service-map
        aws:
          # IAM role that the pipeline assumes to access the domain sink   
          sts_role_arn: "arn:aws:iam::{account-id}:role/pipeline-role"
          region: "us-east-1"
```

The pipeline role that you specify in the `sts_role_arn` option must have write permissions to the domain sink\. For instructions to configure permissions for the pipeline role, see [Allowing Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion pipelines to write to domains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/pipeline-domain-access.html)\.

## Exploring trace data<a name="trace-dashboards"></a>

The **Dashboard** view groups traces together by HTTP method and path so that you can see the average latency, error rate, and trends associated with a particular operation\. For a more focused view, try filtering by trace group name\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/ta-dashboards-dash.png)

To drill down on the traces that make up a trace group, choose the number of traces in the right\-hand column\. Then choose an individual trace for a detailed summary\.

The **Services** view lists all services in the application, plus an interactive map that shows how the various services connect to each other\. In contrast to the dashboard \(which helps identify problems by operation\), the service map helps you identify problems by service\. Try sorting by error rate or latency to get a sense of potential problem areas of your application\.
