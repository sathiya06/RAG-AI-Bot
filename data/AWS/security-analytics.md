# Security Analytics for Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="security-analytics"></a>

Security Analytics is an OpenSearch solution that provides visibility into your organization's infrastructure, monitors for anomalous activity, detects potential security threats in real time, and trigger alerts to pre\-configured destinations\. You can monitor for malicious activity from your security event logs by continuously evaluating security rules and reviewing auto\-generated security findings\. In addition, Security Analytics can generate automated alerts and send them to a specified notification channel, such as Slack or email\.

You can use the Security Analytics plugin to detect common threats out\-of\-the\-box and generate critical security insights from your existing security event logs, such as firewall logs, windows logs, and authentication audit logs\. Security Analytics requires OpenSearch 2\.5 or later\. 

For more information about configuring the Security Analytics plugin, see [Security Analytics](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.5/security-analytics/index/) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

## Security analytics components and concepts<a name="sa-components"></a>

A number of tools and features provide the foundation to the operation of Security Analytics\. The major components that compose the plugin include detectors, log types, rules, findings, and alerts\.

### Log types<a name="log-types"></a>

OpenSearch supports several types of logs and provides out\-of\-the\-box mappings for each type\. You specify the log type and configure a time interval when you create a detector, and from there Security Analytics automatically activates a relevant set of rules that run at that interval\.

### Detectors<a name="detectors"></a>

Detectors identify a range of cybersecurity threats for a log type across your data indexes\. You configure your detector to use both custom rules and pre\-packaged Sigma rules that evaluate events occurring in the system\. The detector then generates security findings from these events\. For more information about detectors, see [Creating detectors](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.5/security-analytics/sec-analytics-config/detectors-config/) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

### Rules<a name="rules"></a>

Threat detection rules define the conditions that detectors apply to ingested log data to identify a security event\. Security Analytics supports importing, creating, and customizing rules to meet your requirements, and also provides prepackaged, open\-source Sigma rules to detect common threats from your logs\. Security Analytics maps many rules to an ever\-growing knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques maintained by the [MITRE ATT&CK]() organization\. You can use both OpenSearch Dashboards or the APIs to create and use rules\. For more information about rules, see [Working with rules](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.5/security-analytics/usage/rules/) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

### Findings<a name="findings"></a>

When a detector matches a rule with a log event, it generates a finding\. Each finding includes a unique combination of select rules, a log type, and a rule severity\. Findings donâ€™t necessarily point to imminent threats within the system, but they always isolate an event of interest\. For more information about findings, see [Working with findings](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.5/security-analytics/usage/findings/) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

### Alerts<a name="alerts"></a>

When you create a detector, you can specify one or more conditions that trigger an alert\. An alert is a notification sent to a preferred channel, such as Slack or email\. You set the alert to be triggered when the detector matches one or multiple rules, and can customize the notification message\. For more information about alerts, see [Working with alerts](https://opensearch.org/docs/2.5/security-analytics/usage/alerts/) in the OpenSearch documentation\.

## Exploring Security Analytics<a name="sa-dashboards"></a>

You can use the OpenSearch Dashboards to visualize and gain insight into your Security Analytics plugin\. The **Overview** view provides at\-a\-glance information including findings and alert counts, recent findings and alerts, frequent detection rules, and a list of your detectors\. You can see a summary view comprised of multiple visualizations\. The following chart, for example, shows the findings and alerts trend for various log types over a given period of time\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/sa-findings-alerts-chart.png)

Further down the page, you can review your most recent findings and alerts\. 

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/sa-findings-alerts.png)

Additionally, you can see a distribution of the most frequently triggered rules across all the active detectors\. This can help you detect and investigate different types of malicious activities across log types\. 

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/sa-detection-rules.png)

Finally, you can view the status of configured detectors\. From this panel, you can also navigate to the create detector workflow\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/images/sa-detectors.png)

To configure your Security Analytics setup, create rules with the **Rules** page and use those rules to write detectors in the **Detectors** page\. For a more focused view of your Security Analytics results, you can use the **Findings** and **Alerts** pages\.

## Configure permissions<a name="sa-permissions"></a>

If you enable Security Analytics on a preexisting OpenSearch Service domain, the `security_analytics_manager` role might not be defined on the domain\. Non\-admin users must be mapped to this role in order to manage warm indexes on domains using fine\-grained access control\. To manually create the `security_analytics_manager` role, perform the following steps:

1. In OpenSearch Dashboards, go to **Security** and choose **Permissions**\.

1. Choose **Create action group** and configure the following groups:     
[\[See the AWS documentation website for more details\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/security-analytics.html)

1. Choose **Roles** and **Create role**\.

1. Name the role **security\_analytics\_manager**\.

1. For **Cluster permissions, **select `security_analytics_full_access` and `security_analytics_read_access`\.

1. For **Index**, type `*`\.

1. For **Index permissions**, select `indices:admin/mapping/put` and `indices:admin/mappings/get`\.

1. Choose **Create**\.

1. After you create the role, [map it](fgac.md#fgac-mapping) to any user or backend role that will manage Security Analytics indexes\.

## Troubleshooting<a name="sa-troubleshoot"></a>

### No such index error<a name="index"></a>

If you have no detectors and you open the Security Analytics dashboard, you might see a notification on the bottom right that says `[index_not_found_exception] no such index [.opensearch-sap-detectors-config]`\. You can disregard this notification, which disappears within a few seconds and won't appear again once you create a detector\.
