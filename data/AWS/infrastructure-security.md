# Infrastructure security in Amazon OpenSearch Service<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, Amazon OpenSearch Service is protected by AWS global network security\. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/)\. To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html) in *Security Pillar AWS Well‚ÄêArchitected Framework*\.

You use AWS published API calls to access OpenSearch Service through the network\. Clients must support the following:
+ Transport Layer Security \(TLS\)\. We require TLS 1\.2 and recommend TLS 1\.3\.
+ Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy \(PFS\) such as DHE \(Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\) or ECDHE \(Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie\-Hellman\)\. Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes\.

Additionally, requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key that is associated with an IAM principal\. Or you can use the [AWS Security Token Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html) \(AWS STS\) to generate temporary security credentials to sign requests\.

You use AWS published API calls to access the OpenSearch Service configuration API through the network\. To configure the minimum required TLS version to accept, specify the `TLSSecurityPolicy` value in the domain endpoint options: 

```
aws opensearch update-domain-config --domain-name my-domain --domain-endpoint-options '{"TLSSecurityPolicy": "Policy-Min-TLS-1-2-2019-07"}'
```

For details, see the [AWS CLI command reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/opensearch/update-domain-config.html)\.

Depending on your domain configuration, you might also need to sign requests to the OpenSearch APIs\. For more information, see [Making and signing OpenSearch Service requests](ac.md#managedomains-signing-service-requests)\.

OpenSearch Service supports public access domains, which can receive requests from any internet\-connected device, and [VPC access domains](vpc.md), which are isolated from the public internet\.
