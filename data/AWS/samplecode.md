## Elasticsearch client compatibility<a name="client-compatibility"></a>

The latest versions of the Elasticsearch clients might include license or version checks that artificially break compatibility\. The following table includes recommendations around which versions of those clients to use for best compatibility with OpenSearch Service\.

**Important**  
These client versions are out of date and are not updated with the latest dependencies, including Log4j\. We highly recommend using the OpenSearch versions of the clients when possible\.


| Client | Recommended version | 
| --- | --- | 
| Java low\-level REST client |  7\.13\.4  | 
| Java high\-level REST client |  7\.13\.4  | 
| Python Elasticsearch client |  7\.13\.4  | 
|  Ruby Elasticsearch client  | 7\.13\.3 | 
| Node\.js Elasticsearch client |  7\.13\.0  |
