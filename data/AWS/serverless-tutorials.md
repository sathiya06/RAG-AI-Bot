# Getting started with security in Amazon OpenSearch Serverless<a name="serverless-tutorials"></a>

The following tutorials help you get started using Amazon OpenSearch Serverless\. Both tutorials accomplish the same basic steps, but one uses the console while the other uses the AWS CLI\.

Note that the use cases in these tutorials are simplified\. The network and security policies are fairly open\. In production workloads, we recommend that you configure more robust security features such as SAML authentication, VPC access, and restrictive data access policies\.
