Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion supports ingesting data into managed OpenSearch Service domains and OpenSearch Serverless collections\. The following tutorials walk you through the basic steps to get a pipeline up and running for each of these use cases\.

**Note**  
Pipeline creation will fail if you don't set up the correct permissions\. See [Setting up roles and users in Amazon OpenSearch Ingestion](pipeline-security-overview.md) for a better understanding of the required roles before you create a pipeline\.
